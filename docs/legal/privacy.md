# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: Oct 4, 2020*

Softwerks LLC ("Company", "we", "us", "our") operates the Backgammon Network (\*.bkgmn.net), an online backgammon service.

The privacy of your data is important. In this Privacy Policy ("Policy"), we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights to your data.

This Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use sites, apps, products, and services ("Services") that are part of the Backgammon Network.

## Information We Collect
We collect data when you use or view our Services.

### Identity & Access
When you sign up for an account, we ask for your email address.

### Website Interactions
When you browse pages on Backgammon Network websites, we collect information that is automatically shared by your browser including:
* IP address
* Date and time of access
* Time zone
* User agent (details about your browser and operating system)

### Anti-Bot Assessments
When you sign up for an account or request a password reset, we use Google's CAPTCHA services as a means of spam protection. Refer to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) for additional information.

### Cookies
A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: www.allaboutcookies.org.

We use [cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) to identify you when you use or browse our Services. Cookies are stored in your browser and transmitted to us whether or not you are logged in to an account.

Cookies are necessary for the function of our Services and are used to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand marketing campaign effectiveness.

## How and Why We Use Information

We use your information for the following purposes:
* **To provide our Services.** For example, to set up and maintain your account. Or, for example, so you can play games with other users.
* **To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.** For example, by providing new versions of our Services. Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will improve their experience with our Services.
* **To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.** For example, by advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns, and understanding and forecasting user retention.
* **To protect our Services, our users, and the public.** For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal obligations; and protecting the rights and property of the Company and others, which may result in us, for example, declining a transaction or terminating Services.
* **To fix problems with our Services.** For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
* **To customize the user experience.** For example, to personalize your experience by connecting you to games appropriate for your skill level.
* **To communicate with you.** For example, by emailing you important account information.

### Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information
Our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account — for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information — for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience.

### Security
While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so.

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted from our servers to your browser.

Most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest. Database backups are encrypted.

We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

### Data Retention
We generally discard information about you when it’s no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it — described in the section above on [How and Why We Use Information](#how-and-why-we-use-information) — and we’re not legally required to keep it.

We delete your data after an account is cancelled within 30 days.

### Sharing
We do not share information with third parties. If the Company is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### Location of Site and Data
Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.

## Your Rights
If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the “GDPR”), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.

### European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:

### California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the “categories” of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law.

In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:

* Identifiers (such as your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);
* Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);
* Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address and time zone);
* Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).

You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the [Information We Collect](#information-we-collect) section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the [How and Why We Use Information](#how-and-why-we-use-information) section. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:

* Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;
* Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;
* Opt out of any sale of personal information; and
* Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.
